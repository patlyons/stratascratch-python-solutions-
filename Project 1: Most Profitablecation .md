# Location Profitability Analysis

## Overview

This project evaluates business performance across locations by comparing average transaction values with average customer signup duration.

## Business Problem

Organizations operating across multiple locations often need to determine which regions generate the strongest financial performance relative to customer engagement. Comparing transaction behavior against customer lifecycle duration can help identify high-performing markets.

## Approach

Customer signup information was combined with transaction data to create a unified dataset. Average signup duration and average transaction amount were calculated for each location before deriving a profitability ratio.

Key steps included:

* Calculating customer signup duration
* Merging transaction and signup datasets
* Aggregating average transaction amounts by location
* Aggregating average signup durations by location
* Calculating profitability ratios for comparison

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
